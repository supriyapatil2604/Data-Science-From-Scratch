# Data-Science-From-Scratch

Data Science From Scratch

This repository contains a collection of projects and practice notebooks developed while learning Data Science from scratch, covering fundamental concepts, data analysis techniques, and machine learning basics using Python. The main objective of this repository is to build a strong foundation in data science by implementing concepts step by step through practical examples and real-world datasets.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and basic machine learning model implementation using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Each notebook focuses on understanding core concepts such as data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

The repository is structured to help beginners and transitioning professionals understand the complete data science workflow, starting from data collection and preparation to model building and performance analysis. Emphasis is given to writing clean, readable, and well-documented code to demonstrate best practices followed in real-world data science projects.

This project also reflects continuous learning and hands-on practice in data science concepts, including statistical analysis, problem-solving, and data-driven decision making. The repository can be extended further with advanced machine learning models, deployment techniques, and real-time data applications.
